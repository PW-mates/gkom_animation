# A small animation program

### Requirements

As part of the project, a program should be created that will enable simple animations for loaded models.
For this you need to implement:

1. support for basic input file type with 3D model: obj
2. Phong shading
3. interpretation of material properties: diffuse, specular
4. point light support - the ability to move the light, edit properties of light
5. the ability to make a simple animation:
(a) inserting and editing keyframes for transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
(b) fixed and linear interpolation between frames
6. perspective camera - the ability to move around the stage and rotate
7. the ability to render animation to a video file
